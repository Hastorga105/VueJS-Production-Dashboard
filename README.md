# VueJS-Production-Dashboard
As part of an internship, I developed this prototype of a web application to monitor production data within the company.
This was my first full stack project, therefore it's quite messy and not the best.
<br>The backend used Node JS, Express and a SQL Server database.
<br>For the frontend I used Vue JS, a javascript framework that, although it was my first time using it, I found it quite intuitive and I got the hang of it relatively fast.
I also used a frontend framework named Vuetify, which allowed me to give my application a Material Design.
